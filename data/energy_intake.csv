"1/Estimates are age-adjusted to the year 2000 standard population using four age groups: 20–44 years, 45–64 years, 65–74 years, and 75 years and over. Age-adjusted estimates in this table may differ from other age-adjusted estimates based on the same data and presented elsewhere if different age groups are used in the adjustment procedure. See Appendix II, Age adjustment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES: Starting in 2001, 24-hour dietary recall data were collected in the mobile examination center (day 1 file) and on a second day by telephone interview (day 2 file). For comparability across survey years, this table is based on day 1 data only. It is recognized that usual intake of macronutrients based on 2 or more days of dietary data would be more precise (see Freedman LS, Guenther PM, Dodd KW, Krebs-Smith SM, Midthune D. The population distribution of ratios of usual intakes of dietary components that are consumed every day can be estimated from repeated 24-hour recalls. J Nutr 140(1):111–6. 2010.) Two days of data are available only in later years of the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Thus, in order to present trends, macronutrient intake estimates on a given day are presented in this table. This table excludes individuals who reported no energy intake. Energy intake included kilocalories from all foods and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, consumed during the previous 24-hour period. Macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) do not sum to 100% because information for alcohol is not shown in the table. See Health, United States, 2013, Table 67, for earlier data years. Standard errors are available in the spreadsheet version of this table. Data for additional years are available. See the Excel spreadsheet on the Health, United States website at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus.htm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
